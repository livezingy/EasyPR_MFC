# EasyPR_MFC
EasyPR comes with the demo based on win32 console, It's inconvenient to test one specified picture. So I created the EasyPR_MFC, which based on VS2013-x64 and opencv3.1. The functions of EasyPR_MFC is as follows:
## Single Test:  test one picture at a time
* The picture to be recognized could be specified by a button;
